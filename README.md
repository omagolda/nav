Some issues with the data:
- Alienably possessed nouns have an unpossessed form (e.g., *tsʼaaʼ* 'basket'). In Wiktionary, the unpossessed form is used as the citation form but it doesn't appear as part of the paradigm. It probably should.
- The verb paradigms are very incomplete and include only small fraction of the possible forms. Keep that in mind when deciding how to use them.
